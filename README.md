# Math105B — Midterm 01 (MATLAB): Hand Curve Approximation

This repo reproduces the Midterm I assignment: draw a hand on a coordinate grid, approximate the boundary curve in MATLAB, and present the method and results.

## Highlights
- Hand outline → curve approximation
- Plots of approximated function(s)
- Clear, reproducible MATLAB script

## Quickstart
1. Open **MATLAB**.
2. Run: `code/MidtermI_AakankshaCheruku.m`
3. Generated figures can be saved into `report/` (uncomment the `saveas` line).

## Structure
```
code/      # MATLAB script(s)
data/      # hand outline image (example)
docs/      # assignment prompt PDF (for context)
report/    # place outputs here (figures/report)
```
